# Interactive and Variable Visualisations of Aggregate Motion
## Depicting Movements of Simulated Flocks
According to Aristotle, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
Craig Reynold's 1986 boids simulation was developed based on the assumption 
made that the overall motion of a flock of organisms in nature could be 
expressed as a cumulation of decisions and behaviours of individual flock 
members themselves. This is a top-down, graphical approach to visualising 
the complex emergent interactions that Reynolds's simple bottom-up solution 
generates. Several modifications and additions are made to the original 
framework, with the intent of emphasising, and heightening appreciation of, 
resultant observable group behaviours.
